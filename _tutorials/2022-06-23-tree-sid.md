## Tree-SID

This tutorial will be dedicated to Tree-SID which is a fresh Multicast technology. It is an innovation based on a controller-based approach to building a tree.

In order to establish the appropriate Tree-SID knowledge we first need to understand two technologies, Multicast and Segment Routing.

# Segment Routing

Segment Routing (hyperlink) is a technology that uses source routing to forward traffic to the destination. Packet is forwarded from segment to segment based on the information carried in it. Segment Routing achieves a stateless IP fabric and delivers a unified end to end policy aware network infrastructure.

Segment Routing takes information from the control plane and inserts it inside the packet to simplify the network. The source chooses a path, and it gets encoded within the packet header as an ordered list of segments. There are two ways to encode that into the packet, MPLS (a stack of labels) and IPv6 header which is called SRv6 (hyperlink).

The segment can be an identifier for any type of instruction forwarding or service. We take this identifier, and we stick it to the packet as a list of segments. That makes sense in Unicast since we have a single destination but in Multicast we do not, we have multiple destinations.

In the following example, we have the source, the destination, and 3 routers. We have a Unicast packet that we want to send from source to destination R1. The source sends the packet to router A, the router A determines the path and encodes it into the packet header as an ordered list of segments. The packet moves along this path by sequentially following the header. The packet eventually reaches R1. However, this would not work on Multicast because at the replication node if you have two receivers, the segment is ordered, and cannot choose one of them.
