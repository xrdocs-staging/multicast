# Dynamic Tree-SID + COE

We already discussed the fundamentals of Tree-SID in previous tutorials. Today we want to showcase the integration of Dynamic Tree-SID with Crosswork Optimization Engine (COE). The Crosswork team has invested time and effort to evolve Tree-SID with an automated and enhanced user experience. We have the option to visualize Tree-SID topology, sessions, policies, and more in line with an automated Multicast solution. In the rest of this article, we will go over screenshots from the COE dashboard and use them to visualize the configurations we have in the routers.

In the following [wiki](https://wiki.cisco.com/display/PCE/Tree-SID+visualization+using+dCloud) we can find configurations used in dCloud to setup this Demo.

[github repo with configs?](https://github.com/lambros90/xrdocs/tree/main/coe-tree-sid)

The topology that will be used is shown below.

Treesid discovery and visualization

Challenge:
Accurate and intuitive visibility into multicast deployments
Effective alignment with controller architecture

Solution:
Discovery and visualization of multicast policies with Controller

Outcome:
Operational agility with ease of visualization
Automation benefits with controller friendly architecture

Itâ€™s a discover through the multicast policies based on the controller with an outcome of operational agility and ease of visualization

Static treesids (with and without FRR) discovery and visualization:
Identified with Name (ID not reported)
Policies configured via PCE, defining all service and points

Dynamic treesids (with and without FRR) discovery and visualization:
Name and id is autogenerated
Policy configured on service endpoints
Day 0 configuration required on PCE and service end points

Treesid visualization includes:
Summary: policy information and state
Nodes: Every entry is a traversal path from root down to one of the leaves

Demo:
Configuring through the SR-PCE nodes directly to the NSO.
Enable root, leaves and policies for this service 
Postman explanation

On traffic engineering view u can see treesid visualization
Frr can be enabled optionally



## SR-PCE Configuration

The PCE holds PCEP sessions with all the routers in the topology. We can verify that by running the following command:

### Command:
```
show pce ipv4 peer
```

### Output:
```
PCE's peer database:
--------------------
Peer address: 198.19.1.1
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.3
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.4
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.5
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.7
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.8
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation, SRv6

Peer address: 198.19.1.99
  State: Up
  Capabilities: Stateful, Segment-Routing, Update, Instantiation
```

### COE Dashboard of topology

![Tree-SID + COE topology.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Tree-SID + COE topology.png)

The above screenshot displays all the nodes in the network that have PCEP sessions with the PCE.

Next step is to check the Tree that has been dynamically created by the PCE. The control plane has already been established and we can see the LSPs that are rooted at 198.19.1.5 (Root Node) wih the corresponding Tree IDs.

### Command:
```
show pce lsp p2mp root ipv4 198.19.1.5 | include Tree
```

### Output:
```
Tree: sr_p2mp_root_198.19.1.5_tree_id_524289, Root: 198.19.1.5 ID: 524289
```

The next output shows the Tree stucture including the Root (Ingress), the Transit nodes and the leaves (Egress) with the corresponding label ID (31000) of the Tree.

### Command:
```
show pce lsp p2mp root ipv4 198.19.1.5
```

### Output:
```
Tree: sr_p2mp_root_198.19.1.5_tree_id_524289, Root: 198.19.1.5 ID: 524289

### COE Dashboard of that Tree

_edit: tha balw photo meta_

Dashboard verifies the Tree-SID path that is rooted at node 5.

All the above conclude the configurations and outputs on PCE node. Now we can move to the Root node.

## Root node

From the root node we can get information such as VRFs, traffic-eng configurations, mvpn and segment-routing configurations

### Command:
```
show vrf L3VPN_NM-MVPN-80
```

### Output:
```
VRF                  RD                  RT                         AFI   SAFI

                                         import  65000:80            IPV4  Unicast
                                         export  65000:80            IPV4  Unicast
```

Now lets check the configuration of that specific VRF. The multicast routing for IPv4 and the bgp auto-discovery are enabled, we will use segment routing P2MP and we will allow default MDT based on P2MP SR policy. There is associated color to the default MDT.

### Command:
```
show run multicast-routing vrf L3VPN_NM-MVPN-80
```

### Output:
```
multicast-routing
 vrf L3VPN_NM-MVPN-80

   bgp auto-discovery segment-routing
   !
   mdt default segment-routing mpls color 80
   mdt data segment-routing mpls 2 color 80
  !

```

There is one important thing to notice in the following command output which is the metric type IGP. Any Tree that is going to be built as part of the default or data MDT is going to be built based on that metric.

### Command:
```
show run segment-routing traffic-eng on-demand color 80
```

### Output:
