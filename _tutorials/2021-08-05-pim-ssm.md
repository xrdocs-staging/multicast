## Introduction to Multicast Series

This introduction will be the start of a new series in the Multicast Xrdocs [Xrdocs](https://www.xrdocs.io/) family called "Introduction to Multicast". Multicast is a technology that reduces traffic by simultaneously delivering a single stream of information to potentially thousands of corporate recipients and homes [Multicast Overview](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/ip_multicast/White_papers/mcst_ovr.html). The cisco portfolio consists of 3 great families, NCS5500, ASR9K and Cisco 8000 and all of them support multicast technology.

## NCS

NCS stands for Network Convergence System and is a part of Mass Scale Metro and Wan Aggregation. It is designed for operational simplicity and to efficiently meet the scaling needs of large enterprises, web, and service providers while offering industry-leading 100 GbE and 400 GbE port density to handle massive traffic growth [NCS 5500 Series](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/network-convergence-system-5500-series/index.html).

## ASR9K

Cisco ASR9K Series Aggregation Service Routers are high performance routers built to server demanding edge markets. It is an edge routing device capable of supporting the application performance required to power 5G service needs while offering a rich features list.

## Cisco 8000

Cisco 8000 Series Routers are cloud-enhanced systems powered by ground-breaking Cisco Silicon One ASICs (Application - Specific Integration Circuit). It is the new class of routing supporting the Internet for the future. These systems can deliver the routing performance and functionality that scale to meet the needs of critical infrastructure. [Cisco 8000](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/8000-series-routers/index.html).

The whole Cisco portfolio can cover multiple multicast features. Regarding the base multicast features we have PIM(SSM, ASM, BiDIR), MSDP, Auto-RP, BSR and MoFRR(TI-MoFRR, RIB Based MoFRR).

## PIM

The most popular Multicast Routing Protocol is the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and we use it to get the traffic from the source to the receivers. PIM does not have its own Multicast routing database, instead it leverages the information within the unicast routing table. The definition of "independent" comes from the fact that the protocol can execute its tasks along with any other protocol as long as the latter can populate the unicast routing table. A major task is to perform reliable RPF checks on the multicast traffic. There are two main PIM protocols, PIM Sparse Mode and PIM Dense Mode. A third PIM protocol, Bi-directional PIM is less widely used. 

## How it works (maybe move it?)

The first thing that needs to happen is the establishment of neighbour adjacencies that assist in the creation of the multicast tree. This tree is the topology of links where multicast traffic can flow. 

PIM uses "Hello" messages to discover directly connected neighbours. There is a destination IP (224.0.0.13) which is reserved by all the PIM routers. The IP protocol is 103 and the TTL for the Hello messages is 1.

## PIM SPARSE MODE

PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is a Multicast routing protocol designed on the assumption that recipients for any multicast group will be separately distributed throughout the network. In this mode a receiver must explicitly choose to join a Multicast stream. Once the locations of the sources and receivers are found, PIM-SM can forward the traffic from the source to the receivers. 

The multicast sources are connected to the FHRs (First Hop Router) and once the FHR receives the multicast packet it will create an (S, G) entry which contains the source and the destination. In addition, the multicast receivers are connected to the LHRs (Last Hop Router). The receivers can either connect dynamically via IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) or statically via interface configuration. 

The next step is for FHRs and LHRs to share the information they have already gathered through signalling. To achieve that, a "central database" is needed to gather and share information. This is called Rendezvous Point (RP) and any Multicast enabled router in the network can be assigned for that role. It should be able to receive multicast state information (S, G) or (* , G) from both FHRs and LHRs and connect them by comparing the information. The FHR has information about a group (G) which the LHR needs the stream from and if those two pieces match the RP should proceed to connect them. Every single router in the network must be informed about the RP and this is done with the following command: 

```sh
ip pim rp-address addIP
```

The LHR receives proper IGMP signalling, creates a (* , G) state and starts the PIM signalling process by creating a Multicast tree. RP is the root for a (* , G) tree or RP tree. LHR sends a Join message. Each router also creates a (* , G) state. The interface receiving the Join is included in the OIL, RPF interface to the RP becomes the IIF. The OILs and IIFs are explained below.

The interface which is used to route upward to the source of the Multicast river is the incoming interface (IIF).

The interface which is used to route away from the source of the Multicast river is the outgoing interface (OIL).

## DR ELECTION

The designated router (DR) is responsible for sending PIM register and PIM join and prune messages towards the RP to inform it about active sources and host group membership. If there are multiple PIM-SM routers on a LAN, a designated router must be elected to avoid duplicating Multicast traffic for connected hosts. The PIM router with the highest IP address becomes the DR for the LAN unless you choose to force the DR election by use of the dr-priority command. The DR priority option allows you to specify the DR priority of each router on the LAN segment (default priority = 1) so that the router with the highest priority is elected as the DR. If all routers on the LAN segment have the same priority, the highest IP address is used as the tiebreaker.
